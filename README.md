# 42_libft
The first proyect of 42 cursus: creating a library with some functions that will be useful later on.
This repository contains all the .c .h and Makefile used for the proyect libft in November 2021.
I do not condone cheating or plagiarism, so do NOT copy my code to validate any other libft proyects, thank you.
If you have any questions about the code please contact me in slack (username: samoreno), I usually answer quickly.
